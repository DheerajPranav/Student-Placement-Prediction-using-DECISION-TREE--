# Student-Placement-Prediction-using-DECISION-TREE
Used many classification algorithms such as Naive bayes , LDA , Logistic Regression , Decsion tree , KNN , SVM and selected DECSION TREE as it is producing highest accuracy.

It takes data which contains Student data such as CGPA,No. of backlogs, Technical skills, Communicaton skills and forms a predictive model , which is further used to predict whether a student can be placed or not.Based on this prediction teachers can take care of students who are predicted as 0.With this a student increase his increase performance and prepare accordingly.

This is the Bar graph of accuracy measures based on different algorithms which we have used in our project and selected Decision Tree s it is providing highest accuracy.
